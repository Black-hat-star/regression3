    "2)Sparse Feature Selection:\n",
    " Lasso Regression tends to yield sparse models by pushing the coefficients of some features to exactly zero. This means that Lasso can effectively eliminate certain features from the model, leading to a simpler and more interpretable model. It performs automatic feature selection by selecting only the most relevant features.\n",
    " \n",
    "Prevents Overfitting:\n",
    "he regularization term in Lasso helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where the number of features is much larger than the number of observations. Lasso encourages a more parsimonious model by shrinking some coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles Multicollinearity:\n",
    "Lasso Regression has the ability to handle multicollinearity, which occurs when two or more features are highly correlated. In the presence of multicollinearity, standard linear regression can have unstable coefficient estimates. Lasso's feature selection property helps in selecting one of the correlated features while setting others to zero.\n",

    "Feature Engineering:\n",
    "Lasso can be used as a tool for feature engineering by providing insights into the relative importance of different features. Researchers and practitioners can use Lasso to identify key features and focus on them in subsequent analyses."

    "Magnitude and Sign:\n",
    "The magnitude and sign of a non-zero coefficient indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between the corresponding feature and the target variable. A positive coefficient suggests a positive association with the target, while a negative coefficient suggests a negative association.\n",
    "Zero Coefficients:\n",

    "\n",
    "Regularization Strength:\n",
    "The regularization strength, often denoted by λ, in Lasso Regression determines the trade-off between fitting the model to the training data and keeping the model simple by shrinking coefficients. Higher values of λ lead to more coefficients being pushed towards zero.\n",
    "\n",

    "7)Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression tends to drive some coefficients to exactly zero. When features are highly correlated, Lasso may select one feature and drive the coefficients of the correlated features to zero. This effectively performs automatic feature selection, choosing one representative feature and discarding others.\n",
    "Sparse Models:\n",
    "\n",

    "Shrinkage of Coefficients:\n",

    "The regularization term in Lasso penalizes the absolute values of the coefficients. When multicollinearity is present, the Lasso algorithm tends to distribute the penalty among the correlated features, shrinking their coefficients towards zero.\n",
    "Robustness to Collinear Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is more robust to the presence of collinear features compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. OLS may lead to unstable or inflated coefficient estimates in the presence of multicollinearity, while Lasso can handle these situations more gracefully.\n",

    "Despite its ability to address multicollinearity, there are a few considerations when using Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Arbitrary Selection of Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific features that are retained and those that are set to zero can depend on the algorithm and the specific dataset. The choice of which feature to keep in the presence of multicollinearity may not always align with domain knowledge.\n",
    "Dependence on Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso is sensitive to the scale of the features. Therefore, it's important to scale the features before applying Lasso Regression to ensure that all features contribute equally to the penalty term.\n",
    "Choice of Regularization Parameter (λ):\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of Lasso in addressing multicollinearity depends on the choice of the regularization parameter (λ). Cross-validation can be used to select an optimal value for λ that balances model fit and sparsity."
